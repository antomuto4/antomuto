  <h2>Some Basic Information</h2>
<br>
<p>My name is Hikaru Amamiya, I'm not big on showing myself in public nor is it my intend to change that or become popular somehow. I'd ike to keep some information hidden away.</a>
<p>Think of me as the guy who pretends he knows what he's talking about, but reality often says otherwise. Trust me, I don't know what I'm saying most of the time, even if you think I'm smart or something.</a>
<br><br>
  <h2>My Interests</h2>
<p>I'm no expert in these topics, however I love both Psychology, Philosophy, Anti-Aging and I guess you could expand that to Immortality.</p>
<p>With Psychology, I'm interested in seeing the true side of Humanity, our real nature - while years are passsing, most of us are just forgetting what or who we really are, the same can be said about Philosophy. I believe that both these sources help us to find ourselves once again.</p>
<p>Anti-Aging and Immortality wise, I believe people have the right to decide when they want to live and when they want to die. It should be under our control, and not some random "timer" that we Humans made up to countdown our own unexpected death.</p>
<p>I think it's no secret that I enjoy reading too, I've always enjoyed reading no matter what. Novels usually hit me the most, I'm the type of guy to say that Novels (which are fictional) often are way more real than a non-fictional book ever can be.</p>

<h2>Please don't talk to me about..</h2>
<br>
<p>If you want to have a discussion with me about politics, I'd rather eat a bullet. I have no interest or intend to join a political conversation, thank you.</p>
<br><br>
  <h2>What is my Purpose?</h2>
<p>Good Question.</p>
